# ![](https://github.com/tstamborski/pixelart-icons/blob/main/png/cmd32.png) Bash Scripts

Collection of my personal bash scripts. The scripts are *mostly* undocumented - i keep them here mainly for backup reason.

## Short Descriptions

*Here I put some descritions for some of my scripts.*

``` for-each.sh command directory ```  
Executes a command for every not-hidden file or subdirectory in the specified directory.

``` for-subdirs.sh command directory ```  
Executes a command for every not-hidden subdirectory (it doesn't touch regular files) in the specified directory.

``` quick-zip.sh directory ```  
Creates a zip archive from the specified directory - it automatically set the archive name to the directory name + `.zip` extension.

``` add-ext.sh extension file ```  
Adds the specified extension to the given file - it checks and do nothing if the file already has needed extension.

``` hello.sh ```  
Silly script which prints "Hello" + current user name from uppercase letter.
